Reed Solomon codes are a group of error-correcting codes that were introduced by Irving S.
Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960.[1] They have many applications, the most prominent of which include consumer technologies such as CDs,
DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, QR Codes, data transmission technologies such as DSL and WiMAX, broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC, and storage
systems such as RAID 6. They are also used in satellite communication.
In coding theory, the Reed Solomon code belongs to the class of non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes. The Reed–Solomon code is based on
univariate polynomials over finite fields.
It is able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding t check symbols to the data, a Reed–Solomon code can detect any combination of
up to t erroneous symbols, or correct up to symbols. As an erasure code, it can correct up to t known erasures, or it can detect and correct
combinations of errors and erasures. Furthermore, Reed–Solomon codes are suitable as multiple-burst bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of b + 1
consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size b. The choice of t is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within wide limits.
